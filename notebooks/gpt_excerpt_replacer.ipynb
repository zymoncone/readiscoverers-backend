There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes. </p> <p> “Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. “The house must have fallen on her.” </p> <p> “Now she is dead,” said the Munchkins, “and we are freed from our slavery.” </p> <p> The little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice: </p> <p> “You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.” </p> <p> Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life. </p> <p> But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything.” </p> <p> “Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh, “and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing to the corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.””",

The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes. </p> <p> “She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy. </p> <p> “The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew.” </p> <p> Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said: </p> <p> “I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me. Can you help me find my way?” </p> <p> The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.”",

It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p> <p> ‘They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,’ she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.</p> <p> ‘I wonder if they will fit me,’ she said to Toto. ‘They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.’</p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.”",

Oh, dear!’ cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. ‘The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?’</p> <p> ‘There is nothing to be done,’ said the little woman calmly.</p> <p> ‘But who was she?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,’ answered the little woman. ‘She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.’</p> <p> ‘Who are the Munchkins?’ inquired Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.’</p> <p> ‘Are you a Munchkin?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.

It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p> <p> ‘They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,’ she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.</p> <p> ‘I wonder if they will fit me,’ she said to Toto. ‘They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.’</p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.”",

Whatever shall we do?’</p> <p> ‘There is nothing to be done,’ said the little woman calmly.</p> <p> ‘But who was she?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,’ answered the little woman. ‘She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.’</p> <p> ‘Who are the Munchkins?’ inquired Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.’</p> <p> ‘Are you a Munchkin?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.

There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn. Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back. While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked. “Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice. “Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder. “Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?” “I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you do?” “I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.” “Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy. “No, for this pole is stuck up my back.””",

If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.” Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, being stuffed with straw, it was quite light. “Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when she had set him down on the ground. “I feel like a new man.” Dorothy was quite surprised at this, for she had expected to see the figure fall to the ground, and lie there, but instead of that, he walked beside her along the path. “Where are you going?” asked the Scarecrow, when he had stretched himself and yawned. “To the Emerald City, to see the Great Oz,” she answered. “Oh, is Oz great?” he said, in a curious tone. “Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise. “No, indeed; I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brains at all,” he answered sadly. “Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.” “Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with you, that Oz would give me some brains?” “I cannot tell,” she returned; “but you may come with me, if you like. If Oz will not give you any brains, you will be no worse off than you are now.””",

Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl. “What can I do for you, my child?” she asked. Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with. “My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.” Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl. “Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap.” “Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.” “And I think I shall need their service just those three times,” answered Glinda, smiling. Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow, “What will you do when Dorothy has left us?””",

Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back. </p> <p> While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked. </p> <p> “Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice. </p> <p> “Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder. </p> <p> “Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?” </p> <p> “I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you do?” </p> <p> “I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.” </p> <p> “Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy. </p> <p> “No, for this pole is stuck up my back.””",

Jack has been much improved since he first came to Oz, because he is now solidly stuffed with sawdust; but of course he can’t last forever, any more than can the Sawhorse. They’re all wooden, you know, and must be replaced in time.””",

Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl. “What can I do for you, my child?” she asked. Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with. “My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.” Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl. “Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap.” “Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.” “And I think I shall need their service just those three times,” answered Glinda, smiling. Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow, “What will you do when Dorothy has left us?””",

Looking through the pages he found the recipe he wanted and said: \"I must have a gill of water from a dark well.\"</p> <p>\"What kind of a well is that, sir?\" asked the boy.</p> <p>\"One where the light of day never penetrates.

When she had first found Dorothy in the prison in Ev, she had been delighted, and had decided to ask her to return with her to the Land of Oz. Now she found, to her regret, that Dorothy was anxious to get back to her aunt and uncle in Kansas, and had promised her relatives to return as soon as she could find a way to do so. Ozma liked the little girl none the less because she could not keep her in her splendid palace, but still it made her a little sad to know that soon her new friend would be lost to her.\"</p>",

Ozma sat at the head of a long table, on a raised platform, with Dorothy on her right hand and the Scarecrow on her left. The Tin Woodman and the Lion sat at the left of the Scarecrow and the Princess Langwidere, when she came in, was seated at the right of Dorothy.

In the throne, which was studded with emeralds and diamonds, sat Ozma of Oz, wearing a robe of royal purple and ermine and a jeweled diadem. The Scarecrow and his friends had been given a place at her right hand. The throne room was very large, with a lofty, dome-shaped ceiling.

It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p> <p> ‘They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,’ she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.</p> <p> ‘I wonder if they will fit me,’ she said to Toto. ‘They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.’</p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.”",

Whatever shall we do?’</p> <p> ‘There is nothing to be done,’ said the little woman calmly.</p> <p> ‘But who was she?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,’ answered the little woman. ‘She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.’</p> <p> ‘Who are the Munchkins?’ inquired Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.’</p> <p> ‘Are you a Munchkin?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.
