There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes. </p> <p> “Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. “The house must have fallen on her.” </p> <p> “Now she is dead,” said the Munchkins, “and we are freed from our slavery.” </p> <p> The little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice: </p> <p> “You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.” </p> <p> Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life. </p> <p> But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything.” </p> <p> “Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh, “and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing to the corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.””",

The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes. </p> <p> “She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy. </p> <p> “The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew.” </p> <p> Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said: </p> <p> “I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me. Can you help me find my way?” </p> <p> The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.”",

It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p> <p> ‘They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,’ she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.</p> <p> ‘I wonder if they will fit me,’ she said to Toto. ‘They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.’</p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.”",

Whatever shall we do?’</p> <p> ‘There is nothing to be done,’ said the little woman calmly.</p> <p> ‘But who was she?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,’ answered the little woman. ‘She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.’</p> <p> ‘Who are the Munchkins?’ inquired Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.’</p> <p> ‘Are you a Munchkin?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.

The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p> <p> ‘They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,’ she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.</p> <p> ‘I wonder if they will fit me,’ she said to Toto. ‘They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.’</p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.”",

Whatever shall we do?’</p> <p> ‘There is nothing to be done,’ said the little woman calmly.</p> <p> ‘But who was she?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,’ answered the little woman. ‘She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.’</p> <p> ‘Who are the Munchkins?’ inquired Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.’</p> <p> ‘Are you a Munchkin?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.

There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’ </p> <p> “‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other. </p> <p> “‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are ears just the same,’” which was true enough. </p> <p> “‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So he painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my first glimpse of the world. </p> <p> “‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer. “‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’ </p> [pagination] “‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer. And when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time I didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone. </p> <p> “‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer. ‘He looks just like a man.’ </p> <p> “‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a tall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone. </p> <p> “I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them. I tried to walk, and when I did so the straw stuck out in all directions, so that I could scarcely see it. This made me very angry, so that I cried out at them. </p>",

It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.” </p> <p> “Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the child. </p> <p> The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered: </p> <p> “My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever.

It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p> <p> ‘They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,’ she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.</p> <p> ‘I wonder if they will fit me,’ she said to Toto. ‘They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.’</p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.”",

Oh, dear!’ cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. ‘The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?’</p> <p> ‘There is nothing to be done,’ said the little woman calmly.</p> <p> ‘But who was she?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,’ answered the little woman. ‘She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.’</p> <p> ‘Who are the Munchkins?’ inquired Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.’</p> <p> ‘Are you a Munchkin?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North. When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.’”",

At once she wound up Tiktok's voice, taking care to give the key as many turns as it would go around. She found this quite a task, as you may imagine if you have ever tried to wind a clock, but the machine man's first words were to assure Dorothy that he would now run for at least twenty-four hours. \"You did not wind me much, at first,\" he calmly said, \"and I told you that long sto-ry a-bout King Ev-ol-do; so it is no won-der that I ran down.\" She next rewound the action clock-work, and then Billina advised her to carry the key to Tiktok in her pocket, so it would not get lost again.\"",

It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p> <p> ‘They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,’ she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.</p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.</p> <p> ‘I wonder if they will fit me,’ she said to Toto. ‘They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.’</p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.”",

Oh, dear!’ cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. ‘The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?’</p> <p> ‘There is nothing to be done,’ said the little woman calmly.</p> <p> ‘But who was she?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,’ answered the little woman. ‘She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.’</p> <p> ‘Who are the Munchkins?’ inquired Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.’</p> <p> ‘Are you a Munchkin?’ asked Dorothy.</p> <p> ‘No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.
