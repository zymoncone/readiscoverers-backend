The body of the Woggle-Bug was rather flat, and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening dark brown color upon the back, while the front was striped with alternate bands of light brown and white, blending together at the edges. Its arms were fully as slender as its legs, and upon a rather long neck was perched its head—not unlike the head of a man, except that its nose ended in a curling antenna, or “feeler,” and its ears from the upper points bore antennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature, curling pig tails. It must be admitted that the round, black eyes were rather bulging in appearance; but the expression upon the Woggle-Bug’s face was by no means unpleasant. For dress the insect wore a dark-blue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk lining and a flower in the button-hole; a vest of white duck that stretched tightly across the wide body; knickerbockers of fawn-colored plush, fastened at the knees with gilt buckles; and, perched upon its small head, was jauntily set a tall silk hat.

Now, I am not going to be stubborn and say that I will not write any more Oz stories, because I have been told that a good and loyal author would rather please his readers than please himself; so as long as you care to read my tales of the Land of Oz I shall do my best to write them, and I hope I may be able to interest you and amuse you as well as I have in the past.</p> <p>Yet I must admit that I have thought best to make you a promise at the same time I make you this new book.

After each accident, Nick had himself repaired by a tin smith, till he was entirely a man of tin, and like the Scarecrow he spends more than half his time in the capitol. Then we must not forget Sir Hokus, a real Knight, who was rescued after seven centuries of imprisonment in Pokes. Now where, but in Oz, could a Knight last for seven centuries, and be so spry, so bold and so full of interesting stories? Where, but in Oz, could one find a Wizard able to whisk one about with magic wishing pills and conjure up Ozcream and pop-overs by a mere puff of magic powder?</p> <p>Another prime favorite in the palace is Scraps. Made from an old patchwork quilt and magically brought to life, Scraps adds a touch of fun and gaiety to all the palace parties, for Scraps is wholly without dignity and can think up verses faster than little boys can think up excuses. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers is a fine fellow, too. He is the whole grand army of Oz, and though not very brave has such a splendid uniform and long shining green beard, just to look at him gives one pleasure and satisfaction. Recently a live statue and a medicine man have come to Ozma's court. The medicine man's chest is a real medicine chest, full of helpful remedies and although no one in the Emerald City ever falls ill Ozma has graciously conferred upon Herby the title of Court Doctor.

i know something unpleasant has happened to you for your face was very sober when i saw it in my magic picture. and whenever you signal me to transport you to this safe place where you are always welcome i know you are in danger or in trouble. dorothy sighed. this time ozma it isnt i she replied. but its worse i guess for uncle henry and aunt em are in a heap of trouble and there seems no way for them to get out of it anyhow not while they live in kansas. tell me about it dorothy said ozma with ready sympathy. why you see uncle henry is poor; for the farm in kansas doesnt mount to much as farms go. so one day uncle henry borrowed some money and wrote a letter saying that if he didnt pay the money back they could take his farm for pay. course he spected to pay by making money from the farm; but he just couldnt. an so theyre going to take the farm and uncle henry and aunt em wont have any place to live. theyre pretty old to do much hard work ozma; so ill have to work for them unless ozma had been thoughtful during the story but now she smiled and pressed her little friends hand. unless what dear? she asked. well said she id like to live here in the land of oz where youve often vited me to live. but i cant you know unless uncle henry and aunt em could live here too. of course not exclaimed the ruler of oz laughing gaily. so in order to get you little friend we must invite your uncle and aunt to live in oz also. oh will you ozma? cried dorothy clasping her chubby little hands eagerly. will you bring them here with the magic belt and give them a nice little farm in the munchkin country or the winkie country or some other place? to be sure answered ozma full of joy at the chance to please her little friend. i have long been thinking of this very thing dorothy dear and often i have had it in my mind to propose it to you. i am sure your uncle and aunt must be good and worthy people or you would not love them so much; and for your friends princess there is always room in the land of oz. dorothy was delighted yet not altogether surprised for she had clung to the hope that ozma would be kind enough to grant her request. when indeed had her powerful and faithful friend refused her anything? but you must not call me princess she said; for after this i shall live on the little farm with uncle henry and aunt em and princesses ought not to live on farms. princess dorothy will not replied ozma with her sweet smile. you are going to live in your own rooms in this palace and be my constant companion. but uncle henry began dorothy. oh he is old and has worked enough in his lifetime interrupted the girl ruler; so we must find a place for your uncle and aunt where they will be comfortable and happy and need not work more than they care to. when shall we transport them here dorothy? i promised to go and see them again before they were turned out of the farmhouse answered dorothy; so perhaps next saturday but why wait so long? asked ozma. and why make the journey back to kansas again?

On these pasteboard heads they sewed sheep's wool for hair, and the wool was colored many tints—pink, green and lavender being the favorite colors. The faces of these false heads were painted in many ridiculous ways, according to the whims of the owners, and these big, burly creatures looked so whimsical and absurd in their queer masks that they were called ""Whimsies."" They foolishly imagined that no one would suspect the little heads that were inside the imitation ones, not knowing that it is folly to try to appear otherwise than as nature has made us. The Chief of the Whimsies had as little wisdom as the others, and had been chosen chief merely because none among them was any wiser or more capable of ruling.

But you were born a girl, and also a Princess; so you must resume your proper form, that you may become Queen of the Emerald City.” “Oh, let Jinjur be the Queen!” exclaimed Tip, ready to cry. “I want to stay a boy, and travel with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and the Woggle-Bug, and Jack—yes! and my friend the Saw-Horse—and the Gump! I don’t want to be a girl!” “Never mind, old chap,” said the Tin Woodman, soothingly; “it don’t hurt to be a girl, I’m told; and we will all remain your faithful friends just the same. And, to be honest with you, I’ve always considered girls nicer than boys.” “They’re just as nice, anyway,” added the Scarecrow, patting Tip affectionately upon the head. “And they are equally good students,” proclaimed the Woggle-Bug. “I should like to become your tutor, when you are transformed into a girl again.” “But—see here!” said Jack Pumpkinhead, with a gasp: “if you become a girl, you can’t be my dear father any more!” “No,” answered Tip, laughing in spite of his anxiety. “and I shall not be sorry to escape the relationship.” Then he added, hesitatingly, as he turned to Glinda: “I might try it for awhile,-just to see how it seems, you know. But if I don’t like being a girl you must promise to change me into a boy again.” “Really,” said the Sorceress, “that is beyond my magic. I never deal in transformations, for they are not honest, and no respectable sorceress likes to make things appear to be what they are not. Only unscrupulous witches use the art, and therefore I must ask Mombi to effect your release from her charm, and restore you to your proper form. It will be the last opportunity she will have to practice magic.” Now that the truth about Princes Ozma had been discovered, Mombi did not care what became of Tip; but she feared Glinda’s anger, and the boy generously promised to provide for Mombi in her old age if he became the ruler of the Emerald City.

Who is the first character the Tin Man kills?,64,2,"“On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them. “We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.” “I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on.” They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her. “We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away.” The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature. So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces.

At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed: “Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed!

Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it. But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while he called to the mice, “Come back!
