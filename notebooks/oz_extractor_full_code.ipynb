There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\n“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.\n“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it doesn’t hurt me to get thrown about.” He walked up to another…",

There, indeed, just under the\ncorner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod\nin silver shoes with pointed toes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\ndismay. “The house must have fallen on her.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“Now she is dead,” said the Munchkins, “and we are freed from our\nslavery.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a\nsweet voice:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We\nare so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for\nsetting our people free from bondage.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman\npossibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked\nWitch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been\ncarried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in\nall her life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with\nhesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have\nnot killed anything.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a\nlaugh, “and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing\nto the corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out\nfrom under a block of wood.””  \n[file:Book1_the_wonderful_wizard_of_oz_pg55-images.html†L270-L298] — The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Chapter II\n\n““What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\nlaugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was\nleft but the silver shoes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she\ndried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are\nyours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up\nthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one\nof the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what\nit is we never knew.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she\ncame out again to the Munchkins and said:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will\nworry about me. Can you help me find my way?”\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy,\nand then shook their heads.”  \n[file:Book1_the_wonderful_wizard_of_oz_pg55-images.html†L323-L343] — The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Chapter II\n\n“Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging\non a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and\nalthough the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty\nfrock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham,\nand tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it\nwith bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she\nlooked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to\nshow he knew what she meant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would\nbe just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted\nher as well as if they had been made for her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFinally she picked up her basket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n“Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City\nand ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.””  \n[file:Book1_the_wonderful_wizard_of_oz_pg55-images.html†L363-L386] — The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Chapter III",

If Oz\r\nwill not give you any brains, you will be no worse off than you are now.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is true,” said the Scarecrow. “You see,” he continued, confidentially,\r\n“I don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get\r\nhurt. If anyone treads on my toes, or sticks a pin into me, it doesn’t matter,\r\nfor I can’t feel it. But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my\r\nhead stays stuffed with straw instead of brains, as yours is, how am I ever to\r\nknow anything?””\r\n[file:Book1_the_wonderful_wizard_of_oz_pg55-images.html†L1546-L1580] — The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Chapter III – How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow",

There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes. </p> <p> “Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. “The house must have fallen on her.” </p> <p> “Now she is dead,” said the Munchkins, “and we are freed from our slavery.” </p> <p> The little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice: </p> <p> “You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.” </p> <p> Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life. </p> <p> But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything.” </p> <p> “Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh, “and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing to the corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.””",

Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before. </p> <p> “How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked. </p> <p> “I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.” </p> <p> This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back. </p> <p> She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn. </p> <p> Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back. </p> <p> While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked. </p> <p> “Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice. </p> <p> “Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder. </p> <p> “Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?” </p> <p> “I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you do?” </p> <p> “I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.” </p> <p> “Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy. </p> <p> “No, for this pole is stuck up my back.””",

She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were. </p> <p> “They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant. </p> <p> At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East. </p> <p> “I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.” </p> <p> She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her. </p> <p> Finally she picked up her basket. </p> <p> “Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.””",

The next arrival was Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.; the “H. M.” meaning Highly Magnified and the “T. E.” meaning Thoroughly Educated. The Woggle-Bug was head professor at the Royal College of Oz, and he had composed a fine Ode in honor of Ozma’s birthday. This he wanted to read to them; but the Scarecrow wouldn’t let him. Soon they heard a clucking sound and a chorus of “cheep! cheep!” and a servant threw open the…",

When he had joined the legs to the body, Tip balanced the figure upon its feet, and found that it stood very well. It lacked a little in grace, perhaps; but that was owing to the fact that Jack was not quite straight. Tip next took four small branches and fastened them to the body in the right places, and these became “hands.” The fingers were not very slender, for the knobby branches were not shaped like those of human beings; but Jack was so pleased with them that he declared they were beauties.
