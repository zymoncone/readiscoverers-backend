Aiming for chunk size consistency is to reduce bias towards longer chunks. Very long chunks dominate rankings simply because they contain more tokens that may match your query. Additionally, too small of a chunk and you will find poor semantic representation. Too large of a chunk and you are increasing the noise and can dilute the signal. Lastly, more constitent chunks means better embedding and search performance since the resources required are more predictable chunk by chunk.\n",
