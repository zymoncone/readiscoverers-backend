"""Package initializer for the `src` package.

This file is intentionally present so that Python treats the `src` directory as a
regular package (not a namespace package). Having an `__init__.py` helps with:

- Explicit package imports (e.g., `from src import app`).
- Tooling and packaging systems that expect a concrete package file.
